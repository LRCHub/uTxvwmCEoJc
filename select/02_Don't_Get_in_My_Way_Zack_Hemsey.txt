Eyes wide shut but they know
Buried alive by the lies in their soul
Their stride of a blind man's stroll
Well for whom does the next bell toll

Too many years to have built what I own
And many dumb fool try to take what I've grown
But these roots go deep and you can't blood a stone

So if you want to push, I'm a shove
And if you're gonna run at me you better do it hard
Cuz I fear no fall, no brawl, no scars

I'm too pounds shy of a bomb
I'm one shade short of alarm
Got two last laughs in my palms

I'm three degrees west of a hurricane
Four wheel drive with a ball 'n chain
My five foot seven is irrelevant

Now see a wise man learns from your mistakes
And lets the blunders of his brother serve to fill his plate
So best be on your way before the tidal wave breaks
Cuz you don't want to come to meet the Reaper that awaits

And you don't want to let this turn into lines of mine and yours
And you don't want to press your luck, better back up and withdraw
Cuz trust me when I tell you you don't want that tooth 'n claw
And you don't want to see inside the mind of a savage kind
But if you do decide that you are gonna play that hand and try
Just think before you act because your actions don't rewind

A man with a grudge and a case
A man with intent on his face
And if a man walks into place
Let it be known I won't hesitate

This a long time coming like a comet pass
Got 'em all fired up from the rocket blast
Let it clog up the sand in that hourglass

We in the title fight, blow for a blow
And you can reap the benefits of what I have to sow
Cuz I'm about that worth of which you don't appear to know

It's a long way down when you're head is in the clouds
And all around the sirens play
Don't get in my way
Don't tell me I should bow
And this is not a game
Don't get in my way

You don't want to say no more than a mime, you can't afford
And you don't want to let this turn into lines of mine and yours
Cuz trust me when I tell you you don't want that tooth 'n claw
And you don't want to see inside the mind of a savage kind
And you don't want that recognition of "oh, there goes that guy"
But if you do decide that you are gonna play that hand and try
Just think before you act because your actions don't rewind

Poisoned by the snakes in the grass
Hoaxed by the rats out the maze
Cuz now it's two hawks in a cage

This a tale of a cautionary kind
This a story of that Icarus design
This a message from the hanged man's twine
This when mother nature rips apart the fault lines

And this the type of think that make a grown man cry
When feeble of the spine crumble underneath the grind
When blessings of the meek lead to lessons of the blind

So amusing the feeling as they race off
Got 'em musing from the pressure as I chase off
Should have thought it through before he turned to face off
Now this fool sounding like he gone and turned his bass off

You don't want to have an escalation of the maimed sort
And you don't want to feel the flame that burns pride
Now you know the reason why those sleeping dogs lie

Long way down when you're head is in the clouds
Don't get in my way
Don't tell me I should bow
Cuz I'm no clown
And this is not a game

You don't want to say no more than a mime, you can't afford
And you don't want to let this turn into lines of mine and yours
And you don't want to press your luck, better back up and withdraw
Cuz trust me when I tell you you don't want that tooth 'n claw
And you don't want that recognition of "oh, there goes that guy"
But if you do decide that you are gonna play that hand and try
Just think before you act because your actions don't rewind

They sicker than a wicked man's whip
And underneath the money and the power is the tip
Of something very dangerous and it's strengthening its grip
And I don't have to tell 'em that they turning pale with albinism
I am not their keepers but I keep my own morale
And isn't everything we do just a matter of decision
So if life is just a prison then I'm breaking out this minute

This an epidemic of the vultures in the playpen
Businessman sticking up the layman out the gate and
Thieves wearing suits but they can never fool the vagrants
And con man bringing 'em treasures of fool's gold
